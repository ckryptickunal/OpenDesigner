# OpenDesigner: export and round trip

Use this when the person wants their system in code, in Figma or in Paper. It works after an OpenDesigner interview or on any existing `opendesigner/` folder.

The DTCG files in `opendesigner/tokens/` are the source of truth. Every other format is generated from them. Never edit an export by hand: change the decision and regenerate.

The engine is `scripts/engine.py` in this skill when it was installed from a release zip. Otherwise it is the sibling opendesigner skill's `scripts/engine.py`. Run it from the project root.

## 1. Code exports (always available)
```
python3 <engine> generate
python3 <engine> validate                   must pass before exporting
python3 <engine> export --format all        or one of: css tailwind dtcg figma paper swift compose
python3 <engine> design-md
```
| Format | Output in `opendesigner/` | Use it |
|---|---|---|
| (canonical) | `tokens/` (DTCG sets plus `opendesigner.resolver.json` for modes) | Style Dictionary, Terrazzo, Tokens Studio, Penpot |
| `dtcg` | `build/dtcg/<name>.resolver.json` | A single resolver file for tools that take one entry point |
| `css` | `build/css/tokens.css` (custom properties, light and dark) | Import once at the app root |
| `tailwind` | `build/tailwind/theme.css` (Tailwind v4 `@theme`) | `@import` it after Tailwind in the main CSS file |
| `swift` | `build/swift/DesignTokens.swift` | Add to the iOS target |
| `compose` | `build/compose/DesignTokens.kt` | Add to the Android UI module |
| `figma` | `build/figma/variables.json` and `build/figma/import/<Collection>.<Mode>.tokens.json` | Import in Figma (below) when there is no MCP |
| `paper` | `build/paper/tokens.json`, `build/paper/tokens.light.css`, `tokens.dark.css` | Paper tokens (below) |

Ask before wiring an export into the person's code, such as their main CSS file, Tailwind config or build. Offer to append `<opendesigner>/assets/output/AGENTS-snippet.md` to their AGENTS.md, so later agents use the tokens.

## 2. Figma
Detect what is connected before promising anything:
- **Remote Figma MCP with `use_figma`** (signed in, Full seat; canvas writes are in beta): it can create variables, styles and frames. If Figma's official skills are installed (`figma-use`, `figma-generate-library`), load them and follow their rules. They know the current API.
- **Figma desktop MCP only** (`get_variable_defs`, `get_design_context`, `get_screenshot`): read-only. Use it to check, not to write.
- **Nothing connected:** hand over `build/figma/import/` (one DTCG file per collection and mode) for Figma's variables import, or `build/figma/variables.json` for Tokens Studio. Say that Figma imports DTCG only in part: one mode per file, sRGB, px, and no composite tokens.

Write flow with `use_figma`:
1. Confirm the target file with the person and suggest working on a duplicate first.
2. Create collections by tier: **Primitives** (ramps and raw sizes, no modes) and **Semantic** (roles aliased to primitives, with Light and Dark modes). The number of modes per collection depends on the Figma plan. Check it before adding more themes.
3. Create variables with explicit scopes (never "all scopes"), and set code syntax to the CSS variable name so developers see `var(--...)`.
4. Add text styles for the type scale and effect styles for the elevation levels.
5. Build one specimen frame per foundation (palette, type, spacing, radius, elevation) and a component sheet, bound to the variables.
6. Read back with `get_variable_defs` and compare against `tokens/`; report any mismatch.
7. When the person or a designer edits in Figma, read the changes back. Apply them as decisions (`engine.py set ... --why "changed in Figma by <name>"`), never by editing token files.

## 3. Paper
Paper's MCP server runs inside Paper Desktop (local, `127.0.0.1:29979/mcp`). If its tools are present:
1. Load Paper's guide first (`get_guide` with topic `paper-mcp-instructions`). Then call `get_basic_info` to see the file.
2. Write tokens from `build/paper/tokens.json` with `create_tokens` or `set_tokens`. Paper tokens are CSS variables without modes. Write the light values, and add the dark ones as a separate, clearly named set.
3. Call `get_font_family_info` before any typography. Then write specimen artboards with `write_html`, one visual group per call: palette, type ladder, spacing ruler, radius, elevation, component sheet. The HTML in `<opendesigner>/assets/templates/` (component sheet, palette) is a good start. Use the person's tokens, not sample data.
4. Review each artboard with `get_screenshot`. Fix clipping by setting the artboard height to fit its content.
5. Call `finish_working_on_nodes` when done.
6. Designer comments (`list_comment_threads`) and selections (`get_selection`) come back as decisions through the engine, like Figma edits.

## 4. Before you hand over
- Explain each export in one plain sentence, then give the path. For example: "This file gives your web app the colors as CSS variables."
- `engine.py validate` passes, or each remaining warning has a written waiver.
- The person knows the source of truth is the DTCG files in `opendesigner/tokens/`, and that exports are regenerated, not edited.
- Record the export in the summary: formats, destinations (file names, Figma file, Paper file) and date.
- If an export was missing, wrong or confusing, record it with `engine.py feedback "..." --kind gap|bug|confusing|idea` (see `references/improve.md` in the opendesigner skill). Nothing is posted without the person's OK.
