# Improving OpenDesigner (the self-improvement loop)

OpenDesigner gets better when the model says out loud what went wrong. This covers BRIEF requirement 16 and lane U3. All four skills link here.

## When to use it
Record feedback the moment you notice one of these:
| Kind | Example |
|---|---|
| `gap` | A building block, question or option is missing. For example, there is no question for chart colors in dark mode. |
| `bug` | The engine or a template gives a wrong or failing result. For example, validate passes a pair that fails contrast. |
| `confusing` | A step made the person hesitate, or a question needed re-asking or explaining twice. |
| `idea` | A better default, wording, visual, or order. |

Don't interrupt the person for this. Record it quietly and mention it once, at the end of the level or the session.

## In someone's project (the usual case)
1. Record it: `engine.py feedback "<area or question id>: <what happened, what you expected>" --kind gap|bug|confusing|idea`. The engine appends it to `opendesigner/feedback.md` and prints a pre-filled issue link for github.com/ckryptickunal/OpenDesigner.
2. Write the text about OpenDesigner, not about their product. Leave out names, customers, private URLs, file contents and anything else they didn't choose to share.
3. At the end, show the feedback in one short list. Offer the link: "Want to send these to the OpenDesigner project? The link opens a pre-filled issue. You review it and press submit yourself." Nothing is posted without their OK.
4. If `gh` is installed and they say yes, you may run `gh issue create --repo ckryptickunal/OpenDesigner` with the same title and body. Show the exact command first.
5. If they are offline, or say no, the notes stay in `opendesigner/feedback.md` and nothing leaves their machine.

## Inside the OpenDesigner repo itself
You know you are in the repo when `_coordination/PROTOCOL.md` and `tools/od.py` exist. In that case, fix the source directly:
1. Edit the source, never a generated copy.
   - Interview text lives in `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` and `skills/opendesigner/references/*.md` (zoom, rules, improve, hooks, guardrails).
   - Questions, options, defaults and cards live in `synthesis/` (`QUESTIONNAIRE.md`, then `python3 tools/build_questionnaire.py`, `levers.json`, `ontology.json`, `glossary.json`).
   - Templates live in `skills/opendesigner/assets/templates/`. The engine, `skills/opendesigner/scripts/engine.py`, is owned by R2: message them instead.
   - Never edit `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `data/`, `references/stages/`, `references/cards/`, `references/*.json` or `chatgpt-project/knowledge/`. They are generated.
2. Rebuild and check:
   ```
   python3 tools/build_data.py && python3 tools/sync_skills.py
   python3 tools/build_data.py --check && python3 tools/sync_skills.py --check
   python3 tools/build_dist.py --check && python3 tools/jev_nav.py check
   ```
3. Record why with `python3 tools/od.py log "<what changed and why>"`. Then sync with `python3 tools/od.py sync -m "<lane>: <what changed>"`, following `_coordination/PROTOCOL.md`. If you don't own the file, send its owner a message with `od.py send` instead of editing it.
4. For a research claim, add the source to the lane's `traces/` file and cite it. If you can't cite it, mark it `[inferred]`.
