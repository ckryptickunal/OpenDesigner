# Zoom levels

People never pick a mode. Everyone starts with a quick sketch of the whole system. Then they zoom into only the parts they care about. They can stop at any level with something that works (BRIEF requirement 14). Each level's questions are in `pacing.json` → `areas[].levels`. Each question's level is in `questions.json` → `zoom`, and in its stage file.

| Level | Name | What the person gets | Rough size |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | sketch | A complete but coarse system: every token exists, every DESIGN.md section is filled from defaults | up to 5 questions, about 3 minutes |
| 1 | broad | One short screen for each foundation: style, density, color use, text, corners, depth, motion, and where the files live | 8 questions, about 8 minutes |
| 2 | defined | One area at a time (for example Color: ramps, roles, contrast) | 1 to 15 questions per area |
| 3 | detailed | Blocks, components and patterns, and the fine print of each area (`stages/*.detailed.md`) | the rest |

## Level 0: sketch (a few questions, one per message)
Five answers shape the sketch. Ask only what their words and files don't already tell you.

1. **What are you making?** Take a free answer and record it: `engine.py set context.product '"<their words>"'`. If the product has a name, pass it as `sketch --name`. It replaces the folder name that `init` used.
   - Take each surface's kind (Q-scope-06) from their words. Say it plainly, like "a site that shows off your club". Pass it with `--surfaces`. When you inferred it, record it before the sketch instead (below, "Assumed answers"). Name the kinds (Persuade, Operate, Read, Experience) only when the designer or engineer voice leads.
   - If they name several surfaces (an app and a landing page), confirm Q-scope-01 in one line. The main surface goes first.
2. **Who is it for?** This is Q-aud-01. Ask whether people use it all day (`dense`), regularly (`regular`), or now and then on the go (`large`).
3. **Where does it run?** This is Q-plat-01. The choices are web, iPhone (`ios`), Android and desktop. Web alone is fine.
4. **How should it feel?** Ask: "Describe the feel in 2 or 3 words, like fun, calm, serious or bold." Pass their words to `sketch --feel`.
   - The engine maps common words to its own (fun to playful, calm to deferential and minimal). `engine.py feel fun calm` shows the mapping, and `engine.py feel` lists every word it knows.
   - If the engine doesn't know a word, it builds with the others and prints one short question. Ask that question with the result.
   - Show six pairs only if they ask for choices, or when the designer voice leads. The pairs are playful or serious · friendly or authoritative · minimal or rich · premium or everyday · modern or heritage · bold or quiet.
   - The words fill in the personality sliders (Q-brand-01), so don't ask for the sliders.
5. **Do you have a brand color or a logo?** This is Q-color-01, asked together with Q-brand-03.
   - A hex color becomes the seed (`--brand`). The engine keeps it exact on main buttons when it passes contrast. If it doesn't, the engine changes it just enough and prints one line: pass that line on.
   - A color word ("blue"): pick a hex of that color that fits their feel words, and pass it as `--brand`.
   - A logo file: if you can see images, find its main color. If you can't, ask "What color is your logo mostly?" Before the sketch, record it with `engine.py set raw.brandColor '"<hex>"' --set-by asset --why "main color of their logo"`, and record the logo with `engine.py set hooks.H-logo.status '"have"' --set-by asset`. Then run `sketch` without `--brand`. A second strong logo color can become a second accent later (Q-color-04, `raw.secondaryColors`).
   - With neither, suggest 3 seed colors that fit their words, and label them as a starting point.

**Don't re-ask.** Skip a question their words or files already answered ("a website" answers where it runs). Log `step_skipped --step <Q-id> --reason known`, and still pass the answer to `sketch`. Say what you took from their words in one line with the result.

**Plain voice: ask fewer.** When the plain voice leads, ask questions 1, 4 and 5. Take who it's for and where it runs from their words when you can. For example, "a website for my school club" means visitors now and then, mostly on phones (`large`), on the web. Record those as assumed answers (below), and say them in one line with the result. Ask question 2 or 3 only when their words give no clue.

**Assumed answers.** An owner input you took from their words, not from an answer, is `assumed` (`rules.md` section 5). Record it before the sketch, and leave its flag out of the `sketch` command, which keeps it:
```
engine.py pick Q-aud-01 large --set-by assumed --why "a club website: visitors come now and then, on phones"
engine.py pick Q-plat-01 '["web"]' --set-by assumed --why "they said a website"
engine.py pick Q-scope-06 persuade --set-by assumed --why "a site that shows off the club"
```

**People in a hurry.** When they say "just pick", "just do it" or "you choose" about the rest:
- Stop asking. Pick values that fit their words and files. For example, reuse the button color already in their CSS as the seed.
- Pass what you picked with `--delegated`, naming those flags (`--delegated feel,brand`). A bare `--delegated` marks every sketch answer as handed over, so use it only when they answered none themselves.
- Log `speed_mode` (`rules.md` section 11). That is delegation. Add a frustration signal only if they sound fed up.
- Ask about who it's for once, and only if nothing points to an answer (`rules.md` section 7). If something does, record it as an assumed answer.
- After the sketch, send the result, the next step and the offer in one short message, with no extra visuals.

Then run one command. It records the answers and builds everything.
```
engine.py sketch --name "<product>" --audience regular --platforms web,ios --feel friendly,minimal [--brand "#167874"] [--surfaces "app:operate,landing page:persuade"] [--delegated feel,brand]
```
Then send the first result (below), and make the offer.

## The first result
Show what they got, not how it was made. Send one message:
1. **One plain line on what they got, in their words.** For example: "Robotics Club now has its colors, text and spacing, in your logo blue, with a fun feel."
2. **The visual,** on the best surface the host has (SKILL.md, visual ladder). Lead with the preview (`engine.py preview --open`).
3. **What you guessed,** in one line: answers you took from their words, and anything the engine changed. For example: "I guessed people visit now and then, mostly on phones. Say if that's wrong."
4. **One clear next step,** the single most useful thing to do now:
   - Plain voice: "Look at the preview and tell me anything that feels off."
   - Engineer voice: the exact file and how to wire it in. For Tailwind v4, two lines in the main CSS file: `@import "tailwindcss";` then `@import "<path to>/opendesigner/build/tailwind/theme.css";`. For plain CSS, import `opendesigner/build/css/tokens.css` once. The opendesigner-export skill lists every file.
   - Designer voice: the one or two defaults most worth a look, such as the body text size. Say where DESIGN.md explains them.
5. **The offer** (below).

Never dump settings: no dial numbers, token names, hex lists or file trees unless they ask. Point a plain-voice person to the preview first. If they want to read something, DESIGN.md opens with a short plain summary.

## Level 1: broad (one screen per foundation)
Go in this order, with the listed templates:
- Q-dir-01, style (`option-gallery`)
- Q-dir-02, how much fits on a screen (`spacing-ruler`)
- Q-color-02, where the brand color shows (`palette`)
- Q-type-01, which font (`type-scale`)
- Q-shape-01, corners (`radius`)
- Q-depth-01, how cards separate (`elevation`)
- Q-motion-01, motion feel (`motion`)
- Q-tool-01, where the master copy lives (text)

Each screen is one message with one question. The person can say "skip", and the default stays. After the last screen, run `engine.py build`. The engine marks each area it touched as `broad` by itself.

## Levels 2 and 3: one area at a time
There are 14 areas: overview, accessibility, platforms, modes, color, typography, layout, shape, elevation, motion, iconography, content, components and delivery. Their plain names are in `pacing.json`. The ids match the engine's, except `delivery`: the engine does not track its zoom level.
1. Zooming into an area asks its skipped lower-level questions first (for Color after the sketch: Q-color-02 from level 1).
2. Open the area's stage files. Ask its level-2 questions in stage order, and skip any marked **Planned** (not built yet). Then run `engine.py build` and show the change.
3. **Plain voice: ask fewer.** When the plain voice leads, ask only three kinds of question: weight `high`, asset hooks, and owner inputs (block class I). Also ask a `medium` question when their words or assets make it matter: a logo with two colors makes Q-color-04 matter. The rest keep their defaults (`auto_default`: nothing to run). Name them in one line of the level summary, like "I also picked the grays and hover colors for you." They can say "ask me everything".
4. Sometimes `pick` says an answer shapes DESIGN.md rules, not tokens. Then say it is saved as a rule, so they don't expect the preview to change.
5. Record the level: `engine.py set zoom.color '"defined"'` (level names: `sketch`, `broad`, `defined`, `detailed`). The engine also infers the level from the decisions made in an area.
6. Level 3 uses `NN-*.detailed.md` in the same way. Pull a level-3 question forward when the product needs it. For example, ask about numbers that line up in columns (Q-type-06) when zooming into Text for a finance or data product.
7. Components live at level 3. Build them from tokens, not from scratch.

## The offer after every level
Keep it short, in plain words:
> That's your first version: everything works, and I picked most of the small choices for you.
> Stop here, or go deeper on one part:
> **Colors** (about 6 min) · **Text** (about 2 min) · **Everything, in 8 quick screens** (about 8 min)

- Offer at most 3 choices. Use each area's plain name and its minutes from `pacing.json` (`areas[].levels["<level>"].minutes`). Pick what matters most for this product. First come areas whose choices change the most (`pacing.json` → `top_decisions`). Then come areas their answers made risky, such as a light brand color or a dense product.
- Accessibility is never an option to skip. Its floors (`guardrails.md` section 4) are already set at level 0.
- "Stop" is a good answer. Finish with the Finish steps in SKILL.md, at whatever level they reached.
- If the journey log is on, run `journey.py level-line <level>`. After the sketch, the engine prints this line itself. If there is a line, put it above the choices, for example "You took 9 steps; the shortest path is 5." If there is none, add nothing.
- The sharing question is not part of the offer. It comes once, at the end of the first session (`rules.md` section 11).
- DESIGN.md shows each section's zoom level. A teammate can see what was decided and what is still a default (SKILL.md, "DESIGN.md stays alive"). When someone asks what a section means, point to its zoom line and offer to zoom in.
