# {{name}} design system

<!-- One section per area. Each section opens with its zoom line. Each decision opens with one plain sentence
and the short "Designers · Code" line; the full designer and engineer notes stay collapsed. -->

## Overview
> Zoom: sketch (0 of 3). Say "zoom into the big picture" to set style, density and principles.
<!-- od:zoom area=overview level=0 -->

{{One plain paragraph: what the product is, who it is for, how it should feel, and the one thing people should remember.}}

## Colors
> Zoom: broad (1 of 3). Say "zoom into Colors" to define ramps, roles and contrast.
<!-- od:zoom area=color level=1 -->

**The brand color shows only on buttons and links.** It keeps the screen calm and makes actions easy to find.
Designers: accent used sparingly · Code: `color.bg.action.primary`
